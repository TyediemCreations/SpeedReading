# SpeedReading
Simple javascript/html based speed reading tool

Requirements/Compatibility: 
  Incompatible with versions of Internet Explorer prior to 8
  due to the usage of 'localStorage' in input.js
  
To run:
  Open 'reading.html'
  
To use:
  Enter an int value for W.P.M. (words per minute- non-integer numbers will be rounded down,
  non-numerical values will default to 230).
  Enter a string value for Text (or, better yet, just copy and paste some text)
  Select 'Start'
  
  User can increment or decrement the W.P.M. by intervals of 10, pause or continue reading,
  move to the next / previous sentence, or move to the next / previous paragraph in the text.
